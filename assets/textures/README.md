# Textures Directory

This directory contains texture files for the 2D Portals Game.

## Required Textures

The following texture files should be placed in this directory:

- `blue_portal.png` - Texture for the blue portal
- `orange_portal.png` - Texture for the orange portal
- `box.png` - Texture for rectangular objects
- `circle.png` - Texture for circular objects
- `background.png` - Background texture (optional)

If these files are missing, the game will use simple colored shapes as fallbacks.
